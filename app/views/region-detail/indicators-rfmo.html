  Much confusion surrounds the notion of ecosystem indicators. Some believe that ecosystem indicators are whatever one
  can measure that impacts ecosystems, for example sea surface temperatures. However, to be of any use, indicators must
  summarize in a single number a variety of complex processes that are otherwise hard to apprehend. Moreover, besides
  description, indicators must also allow for communication, and, ideally, for intervention as well. We present a small
  number of indicators based on the only data available globally on fisheries (i.e., catch data) that we think are
  useable and useful globally. Select an indicator below to view analysis based on Sea Around Us and other data.
