    This component of the Sea Around Us project web site presents information on both historic expeditions,
    and more recent surveys, with emphasis on the fish that were collected. Some older expeditions are described
    using information assembled from journals, other narratives, maps, drawings and other material, while for
    recent surveys, the information provided include the expedition name, year(s), the countries covered and
    the sponsoring institution. References to sources are given when available.
