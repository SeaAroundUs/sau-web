After you clone this project...

1. Install Node/NPM. Then use NPM to install `grunt-cli` (Grunt), `bower`, and `yo` (Yoeman).
2. Install the Ruby Runtime. Then, in the terminal, install "compass" with the command `gem install compass`
3. In the Finder (or File Explorer), navigate to the project's root folder (sau-web). Duplicate the file `aws-keys-template.json` and rename it `aws-keys.json`.
4. In the terminal, navigate your working directory to the root folder (sau-web). Then type `npm install`. It will take a while to do it's thing.
5. Type `bower update`. Wait for that to finish.

That's all. To see the website in your browser, you need to run it via a grunt server. In the terminal, make sure you're working directory is sau-web, then do `grunt serve`.
